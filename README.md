# Diamond Foundry

Welcome to the Diamond Foundry repository! This project is focused on creating a powerful system for managing universal and reusable smart contracts by leveraging the [EIP2535 Diamond Proxy Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535). 

This repository contains the core code for the [Diamond Factory and Facet Registry](https://medium.com/@alexeluca.spataru/achieving-universal-and-reusable-smart-contracts-via-erc2535-diamond-proxy-standard-ba4c9f5ac5bc), which are designed to facilitate the creation of new Diamond proxies and manage their interactions with a library template-like contracts called Facets.

We invite community members to contribute to the project by detecting bugs, developing new Facets, and extending functionality.

## Background

The Forgenie project aims to address the challenges associated with smart contract development and deployment, such as complexity and the need for skilled developers and auditors. By using the [Diamond Management System](https://medium.com/@alexeluca.spataru/transforming-web3-through-a-diamond-management-system-d2efa560ea7f), the project proposes a more accessible and efficient method for building and managing smart contracts across the web3 landscape.
